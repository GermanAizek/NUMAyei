Attention:
While this is very crude solution, in no case use it for multiplayer games, principle hooking functions is used as in cheats.

Todo:
- Hook and rewrite VirtualAlloc to VirtualAllocExNuma for each NUMA node
- More uniform distribution across all core groups and NUMA nodes 2, 4, 6, 8 and more
